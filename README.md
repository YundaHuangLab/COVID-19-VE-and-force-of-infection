This contains the code for the paper “Association between COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy and Force of Infection and Epidemic Force of Infection.”
The project links phase 3 double-blinded clinical trial data with daily force of infection (FoI) estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
By assigning site- and date-specific FoI estimates to participants, we investigate the relationship between vaccine efficacy (VE) and local force of infection.
Each R script corresponds to a specific trial and includes data linkage and modeling steps. The datasets are not publicly available. For any question about this project, please contact jxu@fredhutch.org.
